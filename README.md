### Project Title: Advanced To-Do List Webpage

### Project Description:
The **Advanced To-Do List** webpage is an enhanced version of a task management tool that allows users to add and delete their daily tasks. One of the key features is the integration of **local storage**, which ensures that tasks remain saved even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

   - Tasks are dynamically updated as they are added or deleted.

3. **Local Storage Integration:**
   - Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after the webpage is refreshed.
   - The to-do list automatically loads the saved tasks from local storage when the page is revisited.
   - Provides a more reliable and consistent user experience by retaining user data locally.

4. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Handles task addition, deletion, and retrieval from local storage.
